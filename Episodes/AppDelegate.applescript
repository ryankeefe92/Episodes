ALSO TEST AGAIN USING JUST THIS SUBROUTINE IN AN APPLESCRIPT, WITH DISPLAY DIALOG AND FILES IN DIFFERENT FOLDERS---FILES IN ONE FOLDER ONLY (EACH OF THEM) FILES IN 2 OF 3 FOLDERS (DOWNLOADING AND PROCESSING, DOWNLOADING AND DOWNLOADED, PROCESSING AND DOWNLOADED), FILES IN ALL 3 FOLDERS, WITH JUST ONE FILE, AND MULTIPLE FILES--MULTIPLE EPISODES OF SAME SHOW, EPISODES OF FROM MORE THAN ONE SERIES, ETC...ALL KINDS OF COMBINATIONS TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING WORKS.  DO THE EXIT REPEATS SCREW ANYTHING UP?  OR ARE MORE EXIT REPEATS NEEDED?  INSTEAD OF SETTING SHOULDDOWNLOAD TO TRUE, SHOULD IT JUST RUN THE ARIA SHELL SCRIPT RIGHT THERE?  RIGHT NOW CHECKPROCESSMATCH AND CHECKDOWNLOADINGMATCH ARE SET TO TRUE BY DEFAULT, AND SET TO FALSE WHEN THE FILES ARE FOUND IN OTHER FOLDERS...SHOULD THIS BE REVERSED, AND THEN INSTEAD OF SETTING CHECKPROCESSMATCH AND CHECKDOWNLOADINGMATCH TO TRUE, SHOULD IT JUST RUN THAT CODE WITHIN THE EARLIER REPEAT LOOPS?  OR SHOULD THEY BE MADE INTO SUBROUTINES THAT CAN BE CALLED WITHIN THE EARLIER REPEAT LOOPS?  ARE THERE OTHER PROBLEMS?? ALSO, SHOULD A DELAY BE ADDED, OR SHOULD IT RUN LESS OFTEN THAN EVERY 8 SECONDS, SO THAT WHEN A DOWNLOAD IS CONTINUED AFTER BEING ASSUMED TO HAVE BEEN STOPPED [BECAUSE THE ARIA FILE HASN'T BEEN MODIFIED IN MORE THAN 10 MINUTES], IT HAS A CHANCE TO DISPLAY A NEW .ARIA2 FILE WITH A MORE RECENT CREATED/MODIFIED DATE?  AND FINALLY, IS 10 MINUTES SUFFICIENT TO DETERMINE THAT THE DOWNLOAD HAS STOPPED?  PERHAPS IT IS STALLED DUE TO LACK OF SEEDERS OR SOMETHING...IS THERE A BETTER WAY TO DETERMINE THAT THE FILE HAS STOPPED DOWNLOADING ALTOGETHER?  MAYBE CHECK PROCESSES IN ACTIVITY MONITOR INSTEAD TO DETERMINE IF THE DOWNLOAD IS STILL OCCURRING, ALBEIT SLOWLY??
